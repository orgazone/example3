Orga.Zone Example 3
===================
This is the final example, expanding the tutorial app on (https://github.com/orgazone/example1) with
the communication to a server to keep your data intact - see: (https://orga.zone/en).
 
Our very simple APIv1 server, written in very basic PHP just takes a few commands to keep your
data in sync with the app and the backend database. We will expand the API with some professional
functions during 2015. You may mix that with other cool backend services (http://www.Parse.com) by
Facebook or the Google services.

See screenshot of the app:
(https://apps.orga.zone/up/5/5/screen.png)

It is solely using standard Javascript and HTML5 and simple interface libraries like

*   jquery-mobile
*   handlebars
*   jquery plugins

to give you a native feeling. It uses the localStorage to keep your data and synchronizes the 
data into the API server.

Manifest Usage
--------------------

The contained file "orga.appcache" is the according caching instruction that makes the
app run, even if you are offline. We showed that already with example 1 and expanded the
use here. You can test it, by starting the app and turning your phone into flight mode
afterwards... then keep using the app.

It shows you, how to save key/value pairs on your phone, list and edit them later. It shows
you, how to sync your data into a simple key/value storage server, too!


First of others
---------------------

This is the second, simple example to help you get started with orga.zone. Additionally
we do offer free business app hosting on [apps.orga.zone](https://apps.orga.zone/en/) to upload your
apps as a ZIP file instantly or promote your apps.
